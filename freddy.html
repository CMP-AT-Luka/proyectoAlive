        Freddy isn't as easy to avoid as Bonnie or Chica. he usualy starts moving at night three, but its more active at night four and five.
        In his case, there is two ways he can kill you. One is when the power runs out, he wil apear at the left door whit the melody of Toreador march or Votre brindis de Bizet, je peux vous le rendre (Freddy's theme song).
        If this is the case you you can't avade him, the most you can do is stay still or "play death" so he delays more to attack you, if you are lucky enough you may reach 6am.
        The other way is when he attacks when you have power yet. In this situation, he will jump from the east hall (camera 4-B) to the office.
        To avoid getting killed by him you must check the camera 4-B, if he is there close the right door. Open it again just when he is no longer in the east hall.

        how to spot him
      </button>
    </p>
    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
      <div class="card card-body">
        To spot him isn't very easy. He will constantly try to stay in the dark zones so you can't see him on camera. tha camera you should be most carefull about is 4-B.
        If you see him there make shure to close the door. As for his movements, he apears to have a pattern. Freddy moves whith the next patern: Stage → Dining room → Bathrooms → Kitchen → East hall → Corner of East hall → The Office.
        A song will start playing as soon as he gets to the Dining room. Each time he moves you'll be able to hear his giggle so pay attention to that. As freddy avois cameras as much as posible you'll probably just be able to see his eyes.
        If other animatronic is in the same room he wont be visible. You have to be carefful with him, try to keep a whatch on where he is but remember to save energy and don't forget the other animatronics as freddy is much distraction so they can attack you.
